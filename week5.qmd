## 1 GEE

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is an Earth observation data analysis platform for scientists, researchers, and developers that brings together multiple repositories of satellite and ground-based monitoring data and a range of algorithms for data analysis and visualization.GEE provides a programming environment that can be used directly in a browser, allowing users to use languages such as JavaScript or Python to process and analyze large-scale geospatial data. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) offers the possibility of many specific applications covering a wide range of fields such as environmental monitoring, climate change studies, land cover and land use change, water resource management, agricultural development, urban planning, etc. The GEE is a platform for analyzing Earth observation data, a collection of multiple satellite and ground-based monitoring data repositories, and a series of algorithms for data analysis and visualization.GEE also has a massive catalog of data that we can search and load directly into our script.

## 2 image processing

The image processing methods mentioned in this section are the following three:

One, Processing the scale factor of Landsat surface reflectance products to improve image quality and resolution.

Second, mosaic images, focusing on how to focus on how to visually appear to have a significant gap between the image stitched into a large image. Whether the best solution is to take the average or the median of all overlapping pixels needs to be analysed on a case-by-case basis, and generally speaking the median is better for larger data.

Third, cropping, the image will be cropped to the appropriate shape according to the specific project scope requirements.

## 3 Applications

### 3.1 Texture Measurement

Texture measurement is an important technique in image analysis to identify and classify image regions. In the field of remote sensing, texture can be used to help distinguish between different surface features such as urban areas, farmland, forests, and so on. Texture measurement provides a way to quantify the distribution and arrangement of pixel grey values in an image.

In practice, texture measurement usually involves the following steps:

-   Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM, Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix): This is a statistical method that analyses texture by calculating the spatial relationship between grey levels in an image.
-   Texture Filter: For example, a high pass filter or low pass filter can be used to enhance or smooth the texture of an image.
-   Frequency domain analysis: By methods such as Fourier transform, the image is transformed into the frequency domain for analysis to identify the contribution of different frequency components.

Special attention should be paid to the following when performing texture analysis:

-   Scale: Texture features may exhibit different characteristics at different scales. It is important to choose the right window size and scale when performing texture analysis. Directionality: Some texture features may have significant directionality, and texture measurements need to be selected or designed to capture this.
-   Colour and lighting conditions: Ensuring that the image is not affected by lighting conditions and is properly colour corrected prior to texture analysis may affect the results of the texture measurements.
-   Classification and Interpretation: Texture measurements need to be interpreted in relation to actual surface features, so it is important to understand the geographical and environmental context.

### 3.2 PCA

In Google Earth Engine (GEE), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool often used for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and data compression of remotely sensed data. It does this by transforming the data to a new coordinate system such that the data has the largest variance in the direction of the first principal component, with each subsequent principal component having the next largest variance and being orthogonal to the previous component. In remote sensing, this can help to highlight differences between pixels and is often used to enhance certain features in an image or to reduce redunda nt information in the data.

Here are the results of PCA in practical
