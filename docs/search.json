    "text": "1 Sentinel data and Landsat data\nSentinel: The Sentinel series of satellites is part of Europe’s Global Monitoring for Environmental Security (Copernicus programme), led by ESA.The Sentinel project is designed to provide data for a wide range of environmental and security monitoring, including land, oceans and the atmosphere. Of these, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 are satellites that provide primarily terrestrial data.\nLandsat: The programme has been in operation since 1972 and is the world’s longest land observation satellite project.The Landsat project is jointly managed by NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS).The Landsat series of satellites has a long history, with Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 currently active.\n\n1.1 The differences between Landsat and Sentinel data\nIn addition to the most obvious differences in the Managing Agencies of the two types of satellite data, they also have specialised differences such as Spatial Resolution; Temporal Resolution; and Spectral Bands.\n\n1.1.1 Spatial Resolution\nLandsat satellites, particularly the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 missions, offer a spatial resolution of 15 meters for panchromatic (black and white) imagery, 30 meters for multispectral bands, and 100 meters for thermal bands.The Sentinel satellites include multiple missions with varying capabilities. Sentinel-2, for example, offers higher-resolution data with 10 meters for visible and near-infrared bands, 20 meters for additional infrared bands, and 60 meters for shortwave infrared bands.\n\n\n1.1.2 Temporal Resolution\nLandsat satellites, particularly the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 missions, offer a spatial resolution of 15 meters for panchromatic (black and white) imagery, 30 meters for multispectral bands, and 100 meters for thermal bands.The Sentinel satellites include multiple missions with varying capabilities. Sentinel-2, for example, offers higher-resolution data with 10 meters for visible and near-infrared bands, 20 meters for additional infrared bands, and 60 meters for shortwave infrared bands.\n\n\n1.1.3 Spectral Bands\nThe combined Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 missions provide a revisit time of 8 days at the equator, and this improves with the addition of Landsat 9. The Sentinel-2 mission has two satellites (2A and 2B) working in tandem, offering a revisit time of 5 days at the equator, which is more frequent than Landsat.\n\n\n1.1.4 Primary Uses\nWhile Sentinel data are also used for applications similar to Landsat, including monitoring deforestation, glacier dynamics, urban sprawl, and land use and land cover change, they have specific tasks tailored for different purposes, such as Sentinel-1 for radar imagery (which can be used to monitor sea ice, oil spills, and land motion), and Sentinel-3 for sea ice monitoring, oil spills, and land motion, Ocean and global land monitoring."

    "text": "2 Spectral signatures\nSpectral feature space is widely used in the analysis and processing of remote sensing data, especially in feature classification, target identification, vegetation monitoring, and water quality analysis. By analysing the reflectance or radiation characteristics of targets in different spectral bands, different materials and objects on the surface can be effectively distinguished and identified. In practical applications, the selection of effective spectral bands is the key to improving classification accuracy. By analysing the spectral feature space, it is possible to determine which bands are best able to distinguish between features or materials of interest. Meanwhile, since remote sensing data may contain a large number of spectral bands, it is very complex and computationally intensive to process this high-dimensional data directly. Therefore, data dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., principal component analysis, PCA) are often used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining as much information as possible that is needed to distinguish between features."

    "text": "3 Grating Processing and Spectral Spatial Characterisation Considerations\n\n3.1 Issues to keep in mind when raster processing\nSpatial resolution: choosing the right spatial resolution is critical to the results of the analysis. Too low a resolution may result in the loss of important details, while too high a resolution may increase the computational effort and introduce noise.\nData integration and alignment errors: When using multiple data sources, it is essential to ensure accurate alignment between the different raster layers, as failure to do so may lead to biased analysis results.\nData volume and processing power: raster data can be very large and require sufficient computational resources for efficient processing. An increase in data volume can significantly affect processing times and storage requirements.\nRadiometric and atmospheric corrections: In order to obtain true surface reflectance, radiometric and atmospheric corrections need to be applied to remotely sensed data to remove effects due to variations in sensor and atmospheric conditions.\n\n\n3.2 Issues to be noted in spectral spatial characterisation\nWavelength band selection: different substances have different reflection and absorption properties at specific wavelength bands. Choosing the most sensitive band to the research target is the key to improving the accuracy of the analysis.\nSpectral mixing: In practice, a pixel may contain a mixture of spectral signals from multiple features, which will affect the extraction and analysis of spectral features.\nTemporal variations: The spectral features of features may change over time, such as seasonal variations, vegetation growth cycles, etc., which need to be taken into account when performing temporal analyses.\nSpectral resolution: Spectral resolution is equally important for identifying and classifying features. Hyperspectral remote sensing data provide more detailed spectral information, but also bring higher data processing requirements.\n\n\n3.3 General Considerations\nData quality: data quality directly affects the accuracy of analysis results. Attention needs to be paid to the data acquisition conditions, sensor stability, and the quality of data preprocessing.\nModel and Algorithm Selection: Different analysis objectives and data types may require different models and algorithms. Choosing the right method is critical to obtaining reliable analysis results.\nValidation and Evaluation: Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of the analysis results by comparing and validating them with real data on the ground is an important step to ensure the validity of the research results.\nComprehensive consideration of the above issues and the adoption of corresponding strategies and measures in raster processing and spectral spatial feature analysis can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of remote sensing data analysis."

    "text": "3 Applications\n\n3.1 Texture Measurement\nTexture measurement is an important technique in image analysis to identify and classify image regions. In the field of remote sensing, texture can be used to help distinguish between different surface features such as urban areas, farmland, forests, and so on. Texture measurement provides a way to quantify the distribution and arrangement of pixel grey values in an image.\nIn practice, texture measurement usually involves the following steps:\n\nGray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM, Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix): This is a statistical method that analyses texture by calculating the spatial relationship between grey levels in an image.\nTexture Filter: For example, a high pass filter or low pass filter can be used to enhance or smooth the texture of an image.\nFrequency domain analysis: By methods such as Fourier transform, the image is transformed into the frequency domain for analysis to identify the contribution of different frequency components.\n\nSpecial attention should be paid to the following when performing texture analysis:\n\nScale: Texture features may exhibit different characteristics at different scales. It is important to choose the right window size and scale when performing texture analysis. Directionality: Some texture features may have significant directionality, and texture measurements need to be selected or designed to capture this.\nColour and lighting conditions: Ensuring that the image is not affected by lighting conditions and is properly colour corrected prior to texture analysis may affect the results of the texture measurements.\nClassification and Interpretation: Texture measurements need to be interpreted in relation to actual surface features, so it is important to understand the geographical and environmental context.\n\n”\n\n\n3.2 PCA\nIn Google Earth Engine (GEE), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool often used for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and data compression of remotely sensed data. It does this by transforming the data to a new coordinate system such that the data has the largest variance in the direction of the first principal component, with each subsequent principal component having the next largest variance and being orthogonal to the previous component. In remote sensing, this can help to highlight differences between pixels and is often used to enhance certain features in an image or to reduce redunda nt information in the data.\nHere are the results of PCA in practical"

    "text": "Personal Reflections\n\nAwareness and application reflections on GEE:\n\nGEE offers great potential as a powerful platform for analysing Earth observation data, giving me a deeper understanding of areas such as environmental monitoring and climate change research. Through the ability to process and analyse large-scale geospatial data directly in the browser, I realised the role of data science in solving global problems. The learning curve of GEE was a challenge for me, but also an opportunity to push me to learn new programming languages and techniques. Practically, I learned how to search and load datasets, which was crucial for my project.\n\nPractical Reflections on Image Processing Methods:\n\nLearning about scale factor processing, image mosaicing and cropping techniques for Landsat surface reflectance products gave me a better understanding of remote sensing image processing. In particular, when performing image mosaics, understanding how to deal with overlapping areas and selecting the best pixel value (mean or median) is of practical significance for improving image quality. When applying these image processing methods, I realise that the balance between accuracy and image quality is crucial. This requires me to pay attention not only to technical details but also to careful quality control and evaluation of the data.\n\nReflections on the application of texture measurement and PCA in data analysis:\n\nTexture measurement introduced me to another dimension in image analysis, namely how surface features can be extracted through grey level covariance matrices and texture filters. This was very helpful in improving classification accuracy and understanding changes in ground cover.\nPractising PCA gave me a deep understanding of the importance of downscaling and feature extraction. By transforming the data to a new coordinate system, I was able to identify and interpret key information in the remotely sensed data more effectively. This not only enhanced my understanding of the data, but also improved the efficiency of data analysis.\nIn summary, through the study and practice of GEE, I have gained a more comprehensive understanding of remote sensing data analysis. This has not only enhanced my technical skills, but also made me more aware of the potential of data analysis in solving environmental and social problems. In the future, I hope to continue to learn more about the advanced features of the GEE platform and explore more application scenarios to enhance my research and project development capabilities."
