    "text": "2 Applications\nGEE is widely used in a variety of fields such as environmental monitoring, resource management, urban planning, agriculture, and climate change research. Below are some specific GEE application examples that demonstrate its application capabilities in different scenarios:\nA. Forest and vegetation monitoring GEE can be used to monitor forest cover changes, vegetation health and ecosystem degradation. By analysing multi-temporal satellite data, researchers can track events such as deforestation, the impact of forest fires and the spread of diseases, providing a scientific basis for ecological protection and natural resource management.\nB. Water resources management Using GEE, it is possible to assess changes in water levels in rivers, lakes and reservoirs, monitor drought and flood events, and analyse pollution of water bodies. This is essential for water resources planning, the establishment of disaster early warning systems and improving the efficiency of water quality management.\n\nAnalysis of urban heat island effect Thermal infrared remote sensing data on the GEE platform can be used to identify and analyse the urban heat island effect. By comparing the surface temperature of the city with that of the surrounding rural areas, researchers can assess the effectiveness of urban planning in mitigating the heat island effect, and guide decisions such as urban greening and the selection of building materials.\n\nD, Agricultural applications GEE can be used to monitor crop growth, assess the effects of drought and predict crop yields. By analysing satellite images in different bands, crop health indicators such as Normalised Vegetation Index (NDVI) can be extracted to help farmers optimise irrigation, fertiliser application and pest management.\n\nClimate change research GEE provides a powerful tool for global warming and climate change research. Scientists can use GEE to analyse trends in glacier retreat, sea level rise, temperature change and extreme weather events, as well as the impact of these changes on biodiversity and human society.\n\n\n\nDisaster response and recovery In the aftermath of a natural disaster, GEE can quickly provide satellite imagery of the affected area to help assess the impact of the disaster, such as the extent of flood inundation, earthquake damage and hurricane impacts. This is very useful for disaster emergency response and recovery planning.\n\nThe wide range of applications of GEE is attributed to its ability to handle large amounts of geospatial data, its rich data resources and its highly efficient."

    "text": "3 Personal Reflections\n\nAwareness and application reflections on GEE:\n\nGEE offers great potential as a powerful platform for analysing Earth observation data, giving me a deeper understanding of areas such as environmental monitoring and climate change research. Through the ability to process and analyse large-scale geospatial data directly in the browser, I realised the role of data science in solving global problems. The learning curve of GEE was a challenge for me, but also an opportunity to push me to learn new programming languages and techniques. Practically, I learned how to search and load datasets, which was crucial for my project.\n\nPractical Reflections on Image Processing Methods:\n\nLearning about scale factor processing, image mosaicing and cropping techniques for Landsat surface reflectance products gave me a better understanding of remote sensing image processing. In particular, when performing image mosaics, understanding how to deal with overlapping areas and selecting the best pixel value (mean or median) is of practical significance for improving image quality. When applying these image processing methods, I realise that the balance between accuracy and image quality is crucial. This requires me to pay attention not only to technical details but also to careful quality control and evaluation of the data.\n\nReflections on the application of texture measurement and PCA in data analysis:\n\nTexture measurement introduced me to another dimension in image analysis, namely how surface features can be extracted through grey level covariance matrices and texture filters. This was very helpful in improving classification accuracy and understanding changes in ground cover.\nPractising PCA gave me a deep understanding of the importance of downscaling and feature extraction. By transforming the data to a new coordinate system, I was able to identify and interpret key information in the remotely sensed data more effectively. This not only enhanced my understanding of the data, but also improved the efficiency of data analysis.\nIn summary, through the study and practice of GEE, I have gained a more comprehensive understanding of remote sensing data analysis. This has not only enhanced my technical skills, but also made me more aware of the potential of data analysis in solving environmental and social problems. In the future, I hope to continue to learn more about the advanced features of the GEE platform and explore more application scenarios to enhance my research and project development capabilities."

Hyperspectral remote sensing data provide more detailed spectral information, but also bring higher data processing requirements.\n\n\nPersonal Reflections\nThis week has introduced many introductory aspects of remote sensing, and in addition to the considerations already listed above, it is important to be aware of the following issues, and to adopt appropriate strategies and measures in raster processing and spectral spatial characterisation, so that the efficiency and accuracy of the analysis of remotely sensed data can be significantly improved:\nData quality: data quality directly affects the accuracy of analysis results. Attention needs to be paid to the data acquisition conditions, sensor stability, and the quality of data preprocessing.\nModel and Algorithm Selection: Different analysis objectives and data types may require different models and algorithms. Choosing the right method is critical to obtaining reliable analysis results.\nValidation and Evaluation: Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of the analysis results by comparing and validating them with real data on the ground is an important step to ensure the validity of the research results."

    "text": "1 Summary\n\n1.1 Atmospheric correction\nAtmospheric correction is the process of correcting satellite images for the effects of atmospheric scattering and absorption. This step is essential to improve the accuracy of surface reflectance data. In GEE, many satellite datasets have already been preprocessed to include atmospheric correction, such as the Landsat and Sentinel series. For data that have not been pre-processed, GEE provides tools and algorithms to implement atmospheric corrections, for example using the 6S model (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum) or the DOS (Dark Object Subtraction) method.\n\n\n1.2 Merging images\nMerging images (sometimes called mosaicing or fusion) is the process of combining multiple images into a single image, which is useful when working with large regions or integrating data from different points in time. In GEE, images can be merged using methods such as mosaic() or median(). mosaic() method superimposes images in the order they appear in the set, while median() can take the median value of each pixel, which is very effective in removing clouds and cloud shadows.\n\n\n1.3 Enhancement\nImage enhancement is a set of techniques to improve the quality of an image by adjusting the contrast, brightness, colour etc. of the image. In GEE, the visualize() function can be used to adjust the display parameters of an image, such as setting the minimum and maximum values to change the contrast, or creating a false-colour image by selecting a specific combination of bands. Furthermore, in remote sensing image processing, enhancement is not limited to adjusting contrast and brightness, but also includes a range of advanced techniques such as ratio analysis, filtering, texture analysis, data fusion and principal component analysis (PCA). These techniques can improve the interpretability and application value of image data from different perspectives.\n\n\n1.3.1 Ratio analysis\nRatio analysis, in which the ratio of one band to another is used as the basis for analysis, is particularly useful in highlighting specific surface features and reducing the effects of illumination changes. For example, in vegetation analysis, the ratio of the red and near-infrared bands can be used to emphasise vegetated areas. In GEE, ratio analyses can be achieved by direct manipulation of the bands.\n\n\n1.3.2 Filtering\nFiltering refers to the application of various spatial or temporal filters to smooth, enhance or suppress specific features in an image. In GEE, inbuilt functions such as median filter, high pass and low pass filters can be used to spatially filter a collection of images to remove noise or emphasise features such as edges.\n\n\n1.3.3 Texture Analysis\nTexture analysis involves evaluating the roughness, smoothness or other textural features of patterns in an image. This is very effective in distinguishing areas with different surface features such as urban and natural landscapes.Methods such as grey level covariance matrix (GLCM) can be used in GEE to compute and analyse the texture features of an image.\n\n\n1.3.4 Data fusion\nData fusion is the process of combining data from different sources (e.g., from different sensors or at different times) to improve resolution or to reduce gaps in the data (e.g., cloud coverage).GEE provides several data fusion techniques, such as pixel-level fusion, feature-level fusion, and decision-level fusion, which enable users to perform comprehensive analyses using data from multiple sources.\n\n\n1.3.5 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nPCA is a statistical technique that reduces the dimensionality of data by transforming the data to a new coordinate system while retaining as much variability as possible in the original data. In remote sensing image analysis, PCA is commonly used to enhance contrast in images, remove redundant information with high correlation, and compress data. Although GEE does not provide PCA functions directly, users can implement PCA with custom functions or use other statistical analysis tools on GEE to perform similar data dimensionality reduction and feature extraction."

    "section": "2 Application",
    "text": "2 Application\nBelow I will describe specific applications of the four different analyses:\nA. Application of ratio analysis: vegetation monitoring\nIn vegetation health and growth monitoring, ratio analysis is often used to highlight differences between vegetation and other surface types. For example, the normalised vegetation index (NDVI), which is obtained by calculating the ratio of the near-infrared band to the red band, is a useful indicator of the health and biomass of vegetation. This method is widely used in agricultural management, forest monitoring and ecological research.\nB. Filtering Applications: Urban Planning\nIn urban planning and building identification, filtering techniques can help remove image noise and improve the clarity of building edges. By applying spatial filters, such as edge enhancement filters, city layouts and road networks can be identified more clearly to support urban planning and traffic management.\nC. Texture Analysis Application: Land Use Classification\nTexture analysis is able to extract texture information from images, which can be used to distinguish areas with different surface texture characteristics. This is particularly useful in land use and land cover classification, such as distinguishing between urban built-up areas, agricultural land and forests. Texture features increase the accuracy of classification, especially in high-resolution satellite image analysis.\nD. Data fusion applications: improving image resolution\nData fusion techniques, such as band fusion (Pansharpening), can combine high-resolution panchromatic images with low-resolution multispectral images to produce higher-resolution images. This is critical for applications such as detailed map production, fine agricultural monitoring and urban environmental assessment, as it provides richer surface information.\nE. Principal component analysis applications: environmental monitoring\nIn environmental monitoring and change detection, PCA can be used to reduce redundant information in a dataset while highlighting the most important signals of change. For example, in analysing changes in surface cover or environmental degradation, PCA helps to identify the areas with the most significant changes, thus guiding the implementation of resource management and environmental protection measures."

    "text": "1 Summary\n\n1.1 GEE\nGoogle Earth Engine (GEE) is an Earth observation data analysis platform for scientists, researchers, and developers that brings together multiple repositories of satellite and ground-based monitoring data and a range of algorithms for data analysis and visualization.GEE provides a programming environment that can be used directly in a browser, allowing users to use languages such as JavaScript or Python to process and analyze large-scale geospatial data. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) offers the possibility of many specific applications covering a wide range of fields such as environmental monitoring, climate change studies, land cover and land use change, water resource management, agricultural development, urban planning, etc. The GEE is a platform for analyzing Earth observation data, a collection of multiple satellite and ground-based monitoring data repositories, and a series of algorithms for data analysis and visualization.GEE also has a massive catalog of data that we can search and load directly into our script.\n”\n\n\n1.2 Image Processing\nThe image processing methods mentioned in this section are the following three:\nOne, Processing the scale factor of Landsat surface reflectance products to improve image quality and resolution.\nSecond, mosaic images, focusing on how to focus on how to visually appear to have a significant gap between the image stitched into a large image. Whether the best solution is to take the average or the median of all overlapping pixels needs to be analysed on a case-by-case basis, and generally speaking the median is better for larger data.\nThird, cropping, the image will be cropped to the appropriate shape according to the specific project scope requirements.\n\n\n1.3 Texture Measurement\nTexture measurement is an important technique in image analysis to identify and classify image regions. In the field of remote sensing, texture can be used to help distinguish between different surface features such as urban areas, farmland, forests, and so on. Texture measurement provides a way to quantify the distribution and arrangement of pixel grey values in an image.\nIn practice, texture measurement usually involves the following steps:\n\nGray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM, Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix): This is a statistical method that analyses texture by calculating the spatial relationship between grey levels in an image.\nTexture Filter: For example, a high pass filter or low pass filter can be used to enhance or smooth the texture of an image.\nFrequency domain analysis: By methods such as Fourier transform, the image is transformed into the frequency domain for analysis to identify the contribution of different frequency components.\n\nSpecial attention should be paid to the following when performing texture analysis:\n\nScale: Texture features may exhibit different characteristics at different scales. It is important to choose the right window size and scale when performing texture analysis. Directionality: Some texture features may have significant directionality, and texture measurements need to be selected or designed to capture this.\nColour and lighting conditions: Ensuring that the image is not affected by lighting conditions and is properly colour corrected prior to texture analysis may affect the results of the texture measurements.\nClassification and Interpretation: Texture measurements need to be interpreted in relation to actual surface features, so it is important to understand the geographical and environmental context.\n\n”\n\n\n1.4 PCA\nIn Google Earth Engine (GEE), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool often used for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and data compression of remotely sensed data. It does this by transforming the data to a new coordinate system such that the data has the largest variance in the direction of the first principal component, with each subsequent principal component having the next largest variance and being orthogonal to the previous component. In remote sensing, this can help to highlight differences between pixels and is often used to enhance certain features in an image or to reduce redunda nt information in the data.\nHere are the results of PCA in practical"

    "text": "1 Summary\nThis week’s focus is on supervised classification of images in the machine learning part of Google Earth Engine (GEE). Supervised classification is the process of using labelled training data to train a classifier, and then applying this classifier to an image or collection of images for classification.CART (Classification and Regression Trees) is one of the commonly used supervised classification algorithms.\n\n1.1 CART\nCART is a decision tree algorithm that builds a decision tree by recursively partitioning the dataset into smaller subsets. At each split point (or node), it selects the feature and split threshold that best reduces the impurity (for classification problems) or variance (for regression problems) of the target variable. For classification problems, this means that the algorithm tries to find the features and thresholds that most clearly distinguish between different classes. Ultimately, this process generates a tree structure where the leaf nodes represent the final classification decisions.\n\nThe following training data was selected before classification:\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Random Forest\nRandom Forest is an integrated learning method that performs classification or regression by constructing multiple decision trees and aggregating their predictions. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the dataset and randomness is also applied in the selection of segmentation features. Advantages of this approach include high accuracy, robustness to overfitting, and the ability to handle large numbers of features and data points. Random forests are particularly well suited for dealing with remote sensing data, which typically have high-dimensional feature spaces and complex data structures.\n\nHere are the results of the random forest classification:"

Statistics provided, such as the average of 370 heat-related deaths per year in the city and the disproportionately high vulnerability of certain populations, underscored the urgency of addressing the problem. Worryingly, despite high rates of air conditioning use, a significant number of heat stroke-related deaths occur in homes without air conditioning. This points to deeper issues of access and equity, suggesting that solutions must go beyond increasing air conditioning penetration.The strategies outlined in PlaNYC to combat extreme heat are comprehensive and ambitious. They reflect a strong commitment to sustainable development, environmental justice, and public health.\nAmong other things, the application of data such as the Extreme Heat Vulnerability Index (EHVI) and remote sensing for monitoring greenness and surface temperatures highlights the role of technology in understanding and addressing urban heat. The use of advanced technology and data analysis can help identify the most vulnerable communities, tailor interventions to specific needs, and measure the effectiveness of mitigation strategies over time. However, these solutions can also have issues with scalability, long-term sustainability, and potential unintended consequences. For example, while increasing tree canopy cover is a key strategy for cooling urban environments, it requires ongoing maintenance and community management to ensure its success. Similarly, the emphasis on air conditioning as a cooling solution raises concerns about energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the need for a simultaneous focus on sustainable energy solutions.\nAs climate change continues to intensify, the lessons learned in New York City can inform similar efforts globally, underscoring the importance of local action in the global fight against climate change. ’"
