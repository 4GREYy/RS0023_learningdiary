Of these, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 are satellites that provide primarily terrestrial data.\nLandsat: The programme has been in operation since 1972 and is the world’s longest land observation satellite project.The Landsat project is jointly managed by NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS).The Landsat series of satellites has a long history, with Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 currently active.\n\n1.1 The differences between Landsat and Sentinel data\nIn addition to the most obvious differences in the Managing Agencies of the two types of satellite data, they also have specialised differences such as Spatial Resolution; Temporal Resolution; and Spectral Bands.\n\n1.1.1 Spatial Resolution\nLandsat satellites, particularly the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 missions, offer a spatial resolution of 15 meters for panchromatic (black and white) imagery, 30 meters for multispectral bands, and 100 meters for thermal bands.The Sentinel satellites include multiple missions with varying capabilities. Sentinel-2, for example, offers higher-resolution data with 10 meters for visible and near-infrared bands, 20 meters for additional infrared bands, and 60 meters for shortwave infrared bands.\n\n\n1.1.2 Temporal Resolution\nLandsat satellites, particularly the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 missions, offer a spatial resolution of 15 meters for panchromatic (black and white) imagery, 30 meters for multispectral bands, and 100 meters for thermal bands.The Sentinel satellites include multiple missions with varying capabilities. Sentinel-2, for example, offers higher-resolution data with 10 meters for visible and near-infrared bands, 20 meters for additional infrared bands, and 60 meters for shortwave infrared bands.\n\n\n1.1.3 Spectral Bands\nThe combined Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 missions provide a revisit time of 8 days at the equator, and this improves with the addition of Landsat 9. The Sentinel-2 mission has two satellites (2A and 2B) working in tandem, offering a revisit time of 5 days at the equator, which is more frequent than Landsat.\n\n\n1.1.4 Primary Uses\nWhile Sentinel data are also used for applications similar to Landsat, including monitoring deforestation, glacier dynamics, urban sprawl, and land use and land cover change, they have specific tasks tailored for different purposes, such as Sentinel-1 for radar imagery (which can be used to monitor sea ice, oil spills, and land motion), and Sentinel-3 for sea ice monitoring, oil spills, and land motion, Ocean and global land monitoring."

    "text": "2 Spectral signatures\nSpectral feature space is widely used in the analysis and processing of remote sensing data, especially in feature classification, target identification, vegetation monitoring, and water quality analysis. By analysing the reflectance or radiation characteristics of targets in different spectral bands, different materials and objects on the surface can be effectively distinguished and identified. In practical applications, the selection of effective spectral bands is the key to improving classification accuracy. By analysing the spectral feature space, it is possible to determine which bands are best able to distinguish between features or materials of interest. Meanwhile, since remote sensing data may contain a large number of spectral bands, it is very complex and computationally intensive to process this high-dimensional data directly. Therefore, data dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., principal component analysis, PCA) are often used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining as much information as possible that is needed to distinguish between features."

    "text": "3 Grating Processing and Spectral Spatial Characterisation Considerations\n\n3.1 Issues to keep in mind when raster processing\nSpatial resolution: choosing the right spatial resolution is critical to the results of the analysis. Too low a resolution may result in the loss of important details, while too high a resolution may increase the computational effort and introduce noise.\nData integration and alignment errors: When using multiple data sources, it is essential to ensure accurate alignment between the different raster layers, as failure to do so may lead to biased analysis results.\nData volume and processing power: raster data can be very large and require sufficient computational resources for efficient processing. An increase in data volume can significantly affect processing times and storage requirements.\nRadiometric and atmospheric corrections: In order to obtain true surface reflectance, radiometric and atmospheric corrections need to be applied to remotely sensed data to remove effects due to variations in sensor and atmospheric conditions.\n\n\n3.2 Issues to be noted in spectral spatial characterisation\nWavelength band selection: different substances have different reflection and absorption properties at specific wavelength bands. Choosing the most sensitive band to the research target is the key to improving the accuracy of the analysis.\nSpectral mixing: In practice, a pixel may contain a mixture of spectral signals from multiple features, which will affect the extraction and analysis of spectral features.\nTemporal variations: The spectral features of features may change over time, such as seasonal variations, vegetation growth cycles, etc., which need to be taken into account when performing temporal analyses.\nSpectral resolution: Spectral resolution is equally important for identifying and classifying features. Hyperspectral remote sensing data provide more detailed spectral information, but also bring higher data processing requirements.\n\n\n3.3 General Considerations\nData quality: data quality directly affects the accuracy of analysis results. Attention needs to be paid to the data acquisition conditions, sensor stability, and the quality of data preprocessing.\nModel and Algorithm Selection: Different analysis objectives and data types may require different models and algorithms. Choosing the right method is critical to obtaining reliable analysis results.\nValidation and Evaluation: Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of the analysis results by comparing and validating them with real data on the ground is an important step to ensure the validity of the research results.\nComprehensive consideration of the above issues and the adoption of corresponding strategies and measures in raster processing and spectral spatial feature analysis can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of remote sensing data analysis."

    "text": "2 Applications\nGEE is widely used in a variety of fields such as environmental monitoring, resource management, urban planning, agriculture, and climate change research. Below are some specific GEE application examples that demonstrate its application capabilities in different scenarios:\nA. Forest and vegetation monitoring GEE can be used to monitor forest cover changes, vegetation health and ecosystem degradation. By analysing multi-temporal satellite data, researchers can track events such as deforestation, the impact of forest fires and the spread of diseases, providing a scientific basis for ecological protection and natural resource management.\nB. Water resources management Using GEE, it is possible to assess changes in water levels in rivers, lakes and reservoirs, monitor drought and flood events, and analyse pollution of water bodies. This is essential for water resources planning, the establishment of disaster early warning systems and improving the efficiency of water quality management.\nC. Analysis of urban heat island effect Thermal infrared remote sensing data on the GEE platform can be used to identify and analyse the urban heat island effect. By comparing the surface temperature of the city with that of the surrounding rural areas, researchers can assess the effectiveness of urban planning in mitigating the heat island effect, and guide decisions such as urban greening and the selection of building materials.\nD. Agricultural applications GEE can be used to monitor crop growth, assess the effects of drought and predict crop yields. By analysing satellite images in different bands, crop health indicators such as Normalised Vegetation Index (NDVI) can be extracted to help farmers optimise irrigation, fertiliser application and pest management.\nE. Climate change research GEE provides a powerful tool for global warming and climate change research. Scientists can use GEE to analyse trends in glacier retreat, sea level rise, temperature change and extreme weather events, as well as the impact of these changes on biodiversity and human society.\nF. Disaster response and recovery In the aftermath of a natural disaster, GEE can quickly provide satellite imagery of the affected area to help assess the impact of the disaster, such as the extent of flood inundation, earthquake damage and hurricane impacts. This is very useful for disaster emergency response and recovery planning.\nThe wide range of applications of GEE is attributed to its ability to handle large amounts of geospatial data, its rich data resources and its highly efficient.\nThe study of Mitchell, A. L. et al. (2017) reviews various remote sensing technologies in the context of MRV and REDD+. It evaluates the operational readiness of these technologies and identifies research and development needs to advance methods for use in national forest monitoring systems.\n\n\n\nThe global forest condition, as visualised using satellite derived and modelled current and potential forest cover\n\n\n\n\n\nUse of multi-temporal LiDAR to quantify canopy height and AGB dynamics in tropical peatland forest: a Transect through burnt and adjacent undisturbed peat swamp forest. b Changes in canopy height and AGB associated with different forest conditions; and photographs of c burnt forest, d transition area and e undisturbed forest"

    "text": "3 Personal Reflections\n\nAwareness and application reflections on GEE:\n\nGEE offers great potential as a powerful platform for analysing Earth observation data, giving me a deeper understanding of areas such as environmental monitoring and climate change research. Through the ability to process and analyse large-scale geospatial data directly in the browser, I realised the role of data science in solving global problems. The learning curve of GEE was a challenge for me, but also an opportunity to push me to learn new programming languages and techniques. Practically, I learned how to search and load datasets, which was crucial for my project.\n\nPractical Reflections on Image Processing Methods:\n\nLearning about scale factor processing, image mosaicing and cropping techniques for Landsat surface reflectance products gave me a better understanding of remote sensing image processing. In particular, when performing image mosaics, understanding how to deal with overlapping areas and selecting the best pixel value (mean or median) is of practical significance for improving image quality. When applying these image processing methods, I realise that the balance between accuracy and image quality is crucial. This requires me to pay attention not only to technical details but also to careful quality control and evaluation of the data.\n\nReflections on the application of texture measurement and PCA in data analysis:\n\nTexture measurement introduced me to another dimension in image analysis, namely how surface features can be extracted through grey level covariance matrices and texture filters. This was very helpful in improving classification accuracy and understanding changes in ground cover.\nPractising PCA gave me a deep understanding of the importance of downscaling and feature extraction. By transforming the data to a new coordinate system, I was able to identify and interpret key information in the remotely sensed data more effectively. This not only enhanced my understanding of the data, but also improved the efficiency of data analysis.\nIn summary, through the study and practice of GEE, I have gained a more comprehensive understanding of remote sensing data analysis. This has not only enhanced my technical skills, but also made me more aware of the potential of data analysis in solving environmental and social problems. In the future, I hope to continue to learn more about the advanced features of the GEE platform and explore more application scenarios to enhance my research and project development capabilities."

Of these, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 are satellites that provide primarily terrestrial data.\n\nLandsat: The programme has been in operation since 1972 and is the world’s longest land observation satellite project.The Landsat project is jointly managed by NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS).The Landsat series of satellites has a long history, with Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 currently active.\n\n\n1.1.1 The differences between Landsat and Sentinel data\nIn addition to the most obvious differences in the Managing Agencies of the two types of satellite data, they also have specialised differences such as Spatial Resolution; Temporal Resolution; and Spectral Bands.\n\nSpatial Resolution\nLandsat satellites, particularly the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 missions, offer a spatial resolution of 15 meters for panchromatic (black and white) imagery, 30 meters for multispectral bands, and 100 meters for thermal bands.The Sentinel satellites include multiple missions with varying capabilities. Sentinel-2, for example, offers higher-resolution data with 10 meters for visible and near-infrared bands, 20 meters for additional infrared bands, and 60 meters for shortwave infrared bands.\n\n\nTemporal Resolution\nLandsat satellites, particularly the Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 missions, offer a spatial resolution of 15 meters for panchromatic (black and white) imagery, 30 meters for multispectral bands, and 100 meters for thermal bands.The Sentinel satellites include multiple missions with varying capabilities. Sentinel-2, for example, offers higher-resolution data with 10 meters for visible and near-infrared bands, 20 meters for additional infrared bands, and 60 meters for shortwave infrared bands.\n\n\nSpectral Bands\nThe combined Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 missions provide a revisit time of 8 days at the equator, and this improves with the addition of Landsat 9. The Sentinel-2 mission has two satellites (2A and 2B) working in tandem, offering a revisit time of 5 days at the equator, which is more frequent than Landsat.\n\n\nPrimary Uses\nWhile Sentinel data are also used for applications similar to Landsat, including monitoring deforestation, glacier dynamics, urban sprawl, and land use and land cover change, they have specific tasks tailored for different purposes, such as Sentinel-1 for radar imagery (which can be used to monitor sea ice, oil spills, and land motion), and Sentinel-3 for sea ice monitoring, oil spills, and land motion, Ocean and global land monitoring.\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Spectral signatures\nSpectral feature space is widely used in the analysis and processing of remote sensing data, especially in feature classification, target identification, vegetation monitoring, and water quality analysis. By analysing the reflectance or radiation characteristics of targets in different spectral bands, different materials and objects on the surface can be effectively distinguished and identified. In practical applications, the selection of effective spectral bands is the key to improving classification accuracy. By analysing the spectral feature space, it is possible to determine which bands are best able to distinguish between features or materials of interest. Meanwhile, since remote sensing data may contain a large number of spectral bands, it is very complex and computationally intensive to process this high-dimensional data directly. Therefore, data dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., principal component analysis, PCA) are often used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining as much information as possible that is needed to distinguish between features.\n\n\n1.3 Grating Processing and Spectral Spatial Characterisation Considerations\n\n1.3.1 Issues to keep in mind when raster processing\nSpatial resolution: choosing the right spatial resolution is critical to the results of the analysis. Too low a resolution may result in the loss of important details, while too high a resolution may increase the computational effort and introduce noise.\nData integration and alignment errors: When using multiple data sources, it is essential to ensure accurate alignment between the different raster layers, as failure to do so may lead to biased analysis results.\nData volume and processing power: raster data can be very large and require sufficient computational resources for efficient processing. An increase in data volume can significantly affect processing times and storage requirements.\nRadiometric and atmospheric corrections: In order to obtain true surface reflectance, radiometric and atmospheric corrections need to be applied to remotely sensed data to remove effects due to variations in sensor and atmospheric conditions.\n\n\n1.3.2 Issues to be noted in spectral spatial characterisation\nWavelength band selection: different substances have different reflection and absorption properties at specific wavelength bands. Choosing the most sensitive band to the research target is the key to improving the accuracy of the analysis.\nSpectral mixing: In practice, a pixel may contain a mixture of spectral signals from multiple features, which will affect the extraction and analysis of spectral features.\nTemporal variations: The spectral features of features may change over time, such as seasonal variations, vegetation growth cycles, etc., which need to be taken into account when performing temporal analyses.\nSpectral resolution: Spectral resolution is equally important for identifying and classifying features. Hyperspectral remote sensing data provide more detailed spectral information, but also bring higher data processing requirements."

    "text": "1 Summary\n\n1.1 Atmospheric correction\nAtmospheric correction is the process of correcting satellite images for the effects of atmospheric scattering and absorption. This step is essential to improve the accuracy of surface reflectance data. In GEE, many satellite datasets have already been preprocessed to include atmospheric correction, such as the Landsat and Sentinel series. For data that have not been pre-processed, GEE provides tools and algorithms to implement atmospheric corrections, for example using the 6S model (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum) or the DOS (Dark Object Subtraction) method.\n\n\n1.2 Merging images\nMerging images (sometimes called mosaicing or fusion) is the process of combining multiple images into a single image, which is useful when working with large regions or integrating data from different points in time. In GEE, images can be merged using methods such as mosaic() or median(). mosaic() method superimposes images in the order they appear in the set, while median() can take the median value of each pixel, which is very effective in removing clouds and cloud shadows.\n\n\n1.3 Enhancement\nImage enhancement is a set of techniques to improve the quality of an image by adjusting the contrast, brightness, colour etc. of the image. In GEE, the visualize() function can be used to adjust the display parameters of an image, such as setting the minimum and maximum values to change the contrast, or creating a false-colour image by selecting a specific combination of bands. Furthermore, in remote sensing image processing, enhancement is not limited to adjusting contrast and brightness, but also includes a range of advanced techniques such as ratio analysis, filtering, texture analysis, data fusion and principal component analysis (PCA). These techniques can improve the interpretability and application value of image data from different perspectives.\n\n\n1.3.1 Ratio analysis\nRatio analysis, in which the ratio of one band to another is used as the basis for analysis, is particularly useful in highlighting specific surface features and reducing the effects of illumination changes. For example, in vegetation analysis, the ratio of the red and near-infrared bands can be used to emphasise vegetated areas. In GEE, ratio analyses can be achieved by direct manipulation of the bands.\n\n\n1.3.2 Filtering\nFiltering refers to the application of various spatial or temporal filters to smooth, enhance or suppress specific features in an image. In GEE, inbuilt functions such as median filter, high pass and low pass filters can be used to spatially filter a collection of images to remove noise or emphasise features such as edges.\n\n\n1.3.3 Texture Analysis\nTexture analysis involves evaluating the roughness, smoothness or other textural features of patterns in an image. This is very effective in distinguishing areas with different surface features such as urban and natural landscapes.Methods such as grey level covariance matrix (GLCM) can be used in GEE to compute and analyse the texture features of an image.\n\n\n1.3.4 Data fusion\nData fusion is the process of combining data from different sources (e.g., from different sensors or at different times) to improve resolution or to reduce gaps in the data (e.g., cloud coverage).GEE provides several data fusion techniques, such as pixel-level fusion, feature-level fusion, and decision-level fusion, which enable users to perform comprehensive analyses using data from multiple sources.\n\n\n1.3.5 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nPCA is a statistical technique that reduces the dimensionality of data by transforming the data to a new coordinate system while retaining as much variability as possible in the original data. In remote sensing image analysis, PCA is commonly used to enhance contrast in images, remove redundant information with high correlation, and compress data. Although GEE does not provide PCA functions directly, users can implement PCA with custom functions or use other statistical analysis tools on GEE to perform similar data dimensionality reduction and feature extraction."

    "text": "2 Application\nBelow I will describe specific applications of the four different analyses:\nA. Application of ratio analysis: vegetation monitoring\nIn vegetation health and growth monitoring, ratio analysis is often used to highlight differences between vegetation and other surface types. For example, the normalised vegetation index (NDVI), which is obtained by calculating the ratio of the near-infrared band to the red band, is a useful indicator of the health and biomass of vegetation. This method is widely used in agricultural management, forest monitoring and ecological research.\nFor example, Bajocco, S. et al.(2022)’s study explores the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Leaf Area Index (LAI) in agricultural settings. It aims to develop a comprehensive library of conversion equations for estimating LAI from NDVI data, based on empirical relationships established through extensive literature review and analysis.\n\n\n\nLeaf area index (LAI) seasonal profile of the case studies, computed from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, dots) values according to the equations derived from the following combinations of attributes: (top) crop- and biome-specific equations; (middle) crop- and spatial resolution-specific equations; (bottom) biome- and spatial resolution-specific equations. The grey shadows indicate the 5–95th (light grey) and the 25–75th percentile (dark grey) of the LAI values obtained from the equations considered.\n\n\nB. Filtering Applications: Urban Planning\nIn urban planning and building identification, filtering techniques can help remove image noise and improve the clarity of building edges. By applying spatial filters, such as edge enhancement filters, city layouts and road networks can be identified more clearly to support urban planning and traffic management.\nC. Texture Analysis Application: Land Use Classification\nTexture analysis is able to extract texture information from images, which can be used to distinguish areas with different surface texture characteristics. This is particularly useful in land use and land cover classification, such as distinguishing between urban built-up areas, agricultural land and forests. Texture features increase the accuracy of classification, especially in high-resolution satellite image analysis.\nThis paper by Przemysław Kupidura(2019) investigates the effectiveness of various texture analysis methods, including the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), Laplace filters, and granulometric analysis, for improving land use/cover classification.\n\n\n\nSubsets of images of selected classification variants (test image 3: Sentinel-2): (a) spectral, (b) spectral + gran10, (c) spectral + GLCM7, (d) spectral+ Laplacian, (e) original satellite image.\n\n\nD. Data fusion applications: improving image resolution\nData fusion techniques, such as band fusion (Pansharpening), can combine high-resolution panchromatic images with low-resolution multispectral images to produce higher-resolution images. This is critical for applications such as detailed map production, fine agricultural monitoring and urban environmental assessment, as it provides richer surface information.\nThis study presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) based framework for pansharpening, which is a data fusion technique aimed at enhancing the spatial resolution of multispectral images using high-resolution panchromatic images(Ciotola, M. & Scarpa, G., 2023).\n\n\n\nPansharpening results on the WorldView-3 Adelaide image (crop C).\n\n\n\n\n\nPansharpening results on the WorldView-2 Washington image (crop B).\n\n\n\n\n\nPansharpening results on the GeoEye-1 Washington image (crop B)."

The Google Earth Engine (GEE) offers the possibility of many specific applications covering a wide range of fields such as environmental monitoring, climate change studies, land cover and land use change, water resource management, agricultural development, urban planning, etc. The GEE is a platform for analyzing Earth observation data, a collection of multiple satellite and ground-based monitoring data repositories, and a series of algorithms for data analysis and visualization.GEE also has a massive catalog of data that we can search and load directly into our script.\n”\n\n\n1.2 Image Processing\nThe image processing methods mentioned in this section are the following three:\nOne, Processing the scale factor of Landsat surface reflectance products to improve image quality and resolution.\nSecond, mosaic images, focusing on how to focus on how to visually appear to have a significant gap between the image stitched into a large image. Whether the best solution is to take the average or the median of all overlapping pixels needs to be analysed on a case-by-case basis, and generally speaking the median is better for larger data.\nThird, cropping, the image will be cropped to the appropriate shape according to the specific project scope requirements.\n\n\n1.3 Texture Measurement\nTexture measurement is an important technique in image analysis to identify and classify image regions. In the field of remote sensing, texture can be used to help distinguish between different surface features such as urban areas, farmland, forests, and so on. Texture measurement provides a way to quantify the distribution and arrangement of pixel grey values in an image.\nIn practice, texture measurement usually involves the following steps:\n\nGray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM, Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix): This is a statistical method that analyses texture by calculating the spatial relationship between grey levels in an image.\nTexture Filter: For example, a high pass filter or low pass filter can be used to enhance or smooth the texture of an image.\nFrequency domain analysis: By methods such as Fourier transform, the image is transformed into the frequency domain for analysis to identify the contribution of different frequency components.\n\nSpecial attention should be paid to the following when performing texture analysis:\n\nScale: Texture features may exhibit different characteristics at different scales. It is important to choose the right window size and scale when performing texture analysis. Directionality: Some texture features may have significant directionality, and texture measurements need to be selected or designed to capture this.\nColour and lighting conditions: Ensuring that the image is not affected by lighting conditions and is properly colour corrected prior to texture analysis may affect the results of the texture measurements.\nClassification and Interpretation: Texture measurements need to be interpreted in relation to actual surface features, so it is important to understand the geographical and environmental context.\n\n”\n\n\n1.4 PCA\nIn Google Earth Engine (GEE), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool often used for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and data compression of remotely sensed data. It does this by transforming the data to a new coordinate system such that the data has the largest variance in the direction of the first principal component, with each subsequent principal component having the next largest variance and being orthogonal to the previous component. In remote sensing, this can help to highlight differences between pixels and is often used to enhance certain features in an image or to reduce redunda nt information in the data.\nHere are the results of PCA in practical"

At each split point (or node), it selects the feature and split threshold that best reduces the impurity (for classification problems) or variance (for regression problems) of the target variable. For classification problems, this means that the algorithm tries to find the features and thresholds that most clearly distinguish between different classes. Ultimately, this process generates a tree structure where the leaf nodes represent the final classification decisions.\n\nThe following training data was selected before classification:\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Random Forest\nRandom Forest is an integrated learning method that performs classification or regression by constructing multiple decision trees and aggregating their predictions. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the dataset and randomness is also applied in the selection of segmentation features. Advantages of this approach include high accuracy, robustness to overfitting, and the ability to handle large numbers of features and data points. Random forests are particularly well suited for dealing with remote sensing data, which typically have high-dimensional feature spaces and complex data structures.\n\nHere are the results of the random forest classification:"

Statistics provided, such as the average of 370 heat-related deaths per year in the city and the disproportionately high vulnerability of certain populations, underscored the urgency of addressing the problem. Worryingly, despite high rates of air conditioning use, a significant number of heat stroke-related deaths occur in homes without air conditioning. This points to deeper issues of access and equity, suggesting that solutions must go beyond increasing air conditioning penetration.The strategies outlined in PlaNYC to combat extreme heat are comprehensive and ambitious. They reflect a strong commitment to sustainable development, environmental justice, and public health.\nAmong other things, the application of data such as the Extreme Heat Vulnerability Index (EHVI) and remote sensing for monitoring greenness and surface temperatures highlights the role of technology in understanding and addressing urban heat. The use of advanced technology and data analysis can help identify the most vulnerable communities, tailor interventions to specific needs, and measure the effectiveness of mitigation strategies over time. However, these solutions can also have issues with scalability, long-term sustainability, and potential unintended consequences. For example, while increasing tree canopy cover is a key strategy for cooling urban environments, it requires ongoing maintenance and community management to ensure its success. Similarly, the emphasis on air conditioning as a cooling solution raises concerns about energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the need for a simultaneous focus on sustainable energy solutions.\nAs climate change continues to intensify, the lessons learned in New York City can inform similar efforts globally, underscoring the importance of local action in the global fight against climate change. ’"

This method is particularly useful when the spatial resolution of an imaging sensor limits the level of detail that can be discerned in the image. By analyzing the variation of spectral information within a pixel, it’s possible to infer the presence and proportion of different materials or features that are smaller than the size of a single pixel.\n\n\n1.2 Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA)\nObject-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) is an advanced method in the field of geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing, which involves segmenting an image into meaningful objects or groups of pixels rather than processing individual pixels. This technique is particularly useful for analyzing high-resolution imagery, where the spatial patterns and relationships between different elements within the image become significant.\n\n1.2.1 Key Features of OBIA\nSegmentation: The process begins with segmentation, dividing the image into segments or objects based on spectral similarity, texture, shape, and context. Each segment represents a group of pixels that are similar to each other and likely belong to the same feature on the ground.\nClassification: After segmentation, each object is classified into different categories or classes based on its attributes and the relationships with neighboring objects. This classification can be done using various algorithms, including machine learning.\nAnalysis: OBIA allows for more sophisticated analyses, such as change detection, land use/land cover classification, and vegetation mapping. The analysis considers the attributes of the objects, such as their area, perimeter, shape, texture, and contextual relationship with other objects."

This can enhance the accuracy of land cover classification maps. SW Myint’s(2006) research demonstrates the application of subpixel classifiers with expert system rules to estimate the distribution of various vegetation types in urban areas. Using Landsat TM data from Norman, Oklahoma, the study investigated the correlation between the output of the subpixel classifier and reference data for different types of vegetation, including weeds, artificial grasses, riparian vegetation, trees, and plants.

Results showed that artificial grass and agriculture had the highest correlations with reference data, indicating the reliability of these categories.\n\n\n\nFinal map with all five vegetation distributions derived from the IMAGINE sub‐pixel analysis and expert system rules.

This capability is particularly crucial in applications like urban planning, where the arrangement and relationships between features (e.g., buildings, roads, vegetation) are as important as the features themselves. However, the learning curve for OBIA can be steep, primarily due to the complexity of choosing appropriate segmentation parameters and the subjective nature of defining what constitutes an “object” in various contexts.\n\n\n3.2 Sub-pixel Analysis\nSub-pixel analysis, on the other hand, has opened my eyes to the nuanced details that can be missed in a conventional pixel-based approach, especially in high-resolution imagery where mixed pixels are common. This technique’s ability to estimate the fractional coverage of different land cover types within a single pixel is invaluable for fine-scale environmental monitoring, such as tracking the extent of wetland inundation or the fragmentation of habitats.\nThe precision that sub-pixel analysis offers comes with its own set of challenges, notably in selecting pure endmember spectra and dealing with the inherent assumption of linear mixing within a pixel. The process of accurately identifying and extracting these endmembers from an image can be complex and is critical for the success of the analysis. This complexity underscores the importance of a solid understanding of the spectral characteristics of different materials and the conditions under which they were imaged.\n\n\n3.3 General\nLearning about these techniques has highlighted the evolving nature of remote sensing technology and its growing potential in addressing complex spatial problems. It also underlines the significance of interdisciplinary knowledge, bridging the gap between technological capabilities and domain-specific applications.\nIn conclusion, the journey through OBIA and sub-pixel analysis has been enlightening, challenging preconceived notions of what is visible and measurable from remote sensing imagery. It emphasizes the dynamic interplay between technological advancements and methodological innovation, driving home the point that as our tools grow more sophisticated, so too must our approaches to analyzing and interpreting the data they provide."

Landsat 8, for instance, has two thermal infrared (TIR) bands: Band 10 (10.60 - 11.19 µm) and Band 11 (11.50 - 12.51 µm). The process involves converting the digital numbers (DNs) from these bands into spectral radiance, then into brightness temperature using the calibration constants provided in the Landsat data. This approach allows for the estimation of land surface temperatures (LST), which can be crucial for various applications, including environmental monitoring and studying urban heat islands. Further processing may involve correcting for atmospheric effects and emissivity to improve accuracy.\nBut in this week’s practical we use B10, below is a temperature image of Beijing obtained from Landsat data.\n\n\n\n1.2 MODIS\nTo obtain temperature data using MODIS, you typically utilize the Land Surface Temperature (LST) products, such as MOD11A1 for daily LST or MOD11A2 for 8-day LST averages. These products offer measurements in Kelvin and cover both day and night times, leveraging the thermal infrared sensors on the MODIS instrument aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Processing includes converting digital numbers into brightness temperatures, factoring in emissivity adjustments for more accurate surface temperature readings. This data is valuable for a wide range of applications, from climate studies to agricultural monitoring.\nThe following is the temperature image of Beijing obtained by MODIS.\n\n\n\n1.3 others\nThe real benefit of MODIS data is that we can plot the time series, however in doing so we lose the spatial element. In addition to this, we can use both Landsat and MODIS to analyse Statistics per spatial unit and Trend analysis."

(2015) focused on improving the temporal resolution of Landsat-8 Land Surface Temperature (LST) images by fusing them with MODIS data, a new approach called Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion Model (STI-FM) was developed. Implemented over a heterogeneous semi-arid region in Jordan, the Middle East, the study establishes linear relationships between two consecutive MODIS 8-day composite LST images and a Landsat-8 LST image to predict a synthetic Landsat-8 LST image at a future time point. The method showed strong linear relationships between consecutive MODIS LST images and high agreement between synthetic and actual Landsat-8 LST images through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. This innovative approach could significantly benefit satellite systems with similar spectral and orbital configurations and is applicable across various ecosystems beyond semi-arid areas.\n\n\n2.2 Heat index\nAbout the heat index，I found a interesting article called “Probabilistic projections of increased heat stress driven by climate change”, which presents an analysis on how the heat index might change with global warming, applying the Rothfusz equation to historical data and various climate change scenarios(Vargas Zeppetello, L.R., Raftery, A.E. & Battisti, D.S., 2022)."

    "text": "3 Personal Reflection\nThe stark realities that these themes reveal about the future of our planet are not only an academic exercise, but also a much-needed litmus test for climate action. LST data from Landsat and MODIS are tools that provide invaluable insights into the state of the Earth’s surface, highlighting a fundamental aspect of the planet’s health. Understanding the thermal characteristics of different land covers, from cities to forests, allows us to understand the complex interactions between the surface and the atmosphere. This knowledge is critical for a variety of applications such as urban planning, agriculture and climate science, and provides a lens through which to observe the direct impacts of land-use change and urbanisation on local climate.\nWhat struck me most was the interconnectedness of these issues. lST and heat indices are more than just temperature indicators; they are indicators of human well-being, economic stability, and ecological balance. Recognising that these challenges are looming in my lifetime and will have an even more serious impact on future generations, I call for action. It underscores the urgency of adopting sustainable practices, advocating for effective climate policies, and supporting the scientific research that guides these efforts.\nAs I reflect on these lessons, I am motivated not by despair, but by the clarity of purpose they provide. Understanding the mechanisms of global warming and the consequences of inaction provides clear guidance for change. It reminds us that science and knowledge are our best tools for creating a sustainable future. The task ahead is daunting, but the path is clear: we must use our understanding of surface temperatures, heat indices and other climate-related indicators to mitigate the effects of climate change and adapt to its inevitable impacts. The time to act is now; the future of our planet and the well-being of all its inhabitants depend on it."
